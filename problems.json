    "explanation": "Any even weight w except 2 can be divided as 2 and w - 2. For example 10 as 8 and 2 or 16 as 14 and 2. However this is not possible for w = 2. For w = 2 only possible division is 1 and 1. We cannot do 2 and 0 since it is mentioned that each one should receive a positive. Any odd weight cannot be divided into two even parts as any odd number can't be sum of two even numbers."

    "explanation": ["Each query can either be converted into a list or a string. Here we simply take the input as a string. The string taken as input is then, say, '1 0 1'. It contains the digits (as str) as well as the spaces. We need to only count the number of '1's. So we use string.count('1'). If we had taken as list we could use the same way list_name.count('1') {if the digtis are mapped as strs) or list_name.count(1) {if the digits are mapped as integers.",
